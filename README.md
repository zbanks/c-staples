# C Staples
A collection of C libraries, functions, and techniques that I've used in other projects. 

(Some are pretty bad and probably misguided.)

## Contents

* `ini_config` -- Serialize & deserialize `.ini` files into C structs. Makes heavy use of C preprocessor, supports multiple datatypes and arrays. Used in early version of Radiance.
* `structs` -- Proof-of-concept for "private" fields in a struct.
* `pq` -- Min-heap priority queue.
* `hv` -- Type-safe generic datastructures that almost behave like normal types.
